mreg is an API (intended to be as RESTful as possible) for managing DNS.

An associated project for a command line interface using the mreg API is available at:
[mreg-cli](https://github.com/unioslo/mreg-cli/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

If you want to set up your own PostgreSQL server by installing the necessary packages manually, you might need to install dependencies for setting up the citext extension. On Fedora, the package is called [`postgresql-contrib`](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/postgresql/postgresql-contrib/).

### Installing

#### Using Docker

Pre-built Docker images are available from [`ghcr.io/unioslo/mreg`](https://ghcr.io/unioslo/mreg):

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/unioslo/mreg
```

You can also build locally, from the source:

```bash
docker build -t mreg .
```

It is expected that you mount a custom "mregsite" directory on /app/mregsite:

```bash
docker run \
  --mount type=bind,source=$HOME/customsettings,destination=/app/mregsite,readonly \
  ghcr.io/unioslo/mreg:latest
```

To access application logs outside the container, also mount `/app/logs`.

It is also possible to not mount a settings directory, and to supply database login details in environment variables instead, overriding the default values found in `mregsite/settings.py`.

```bash
docker run --network host \
  -e MREG_DB_HOST=my_postgres_host -e MREG_DB_NAME=mreg -e MREG_DB_USER=mreg -e MREG_DB_PASSWORD=mreg \
  ghcr.io/unioslo/mreg:latest
```

For a full example, see `docker-compose.yml`.

#### Manually

> [!TIP] 
> Depending on your operating system, you may need to install additional packages to get the necessary dependencies for the project. At the very least you will probably require development packages for Python 3.

##### A step by step

Start by cloning the project from github. You need a terminal and the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> mreg relies on PEP 735 dependency groups for development, which is [not supported by pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12963) as of version 24.3.1.

When you've got your copy of the mreg directory, set up the venv and install the dependencies:

```bash
> uv sync --frozen
```

<details>
  <summary>Activating the venv (optional)</summary>

Optionally, you can also activate the created virtual environment. However, we will use `uv run` to run the commands in the virtual environment in this guide, which foregoes the need to activate the environment.

```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
```

Activating the venv allows you to run the commands with `python` instead of `uv run`.
</details>

Perform database migrations:

```bash
> uv run manage.py migrate
```

Load sample data from fixtures into the now migrated database:

```bash
> uv run manage.py loaddata mreg/fixtures/fixtures.json
```

And finally, run the server:

```bash
> uv run manage.py runserver
```

You should now be able to open up a browser and go to http://localhost:8000/hosts/ and see
a list of hosts provided by the sample data. Or, you could perform a GET request to see
the returned data.

```bash
> curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/hosts/
[{"name":"ns1.uio.no"},{"name":"ns2.uio.no"},{"name":"lucario.uio.no"},{"name":"stewie.uio.no"},{"name":"vepsebol.uio.no"}
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests for the system, simply run

```bash
> uv run manage.py test
```

## Local Settings

To override entries in `mregsite/settings.py`, create a file `mregsite/local_settings.py` and add the entries there.
For example, the default database setup in `settings.py` uses sqlite3, but if you set up your postgres database
you'll want to override this when testing. To to this, just add the following to your `local_settings.py` file:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'mreg_sample',
        'USER': 'mreg_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'mregdbpass',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
    }
}
```

## Contributing

Patches and PRs are welcome. However, there are a number of intricacies in both code structure and internal
expectations, so you should probably get in touch with the project maintainers before you start working on
anything major. If in doubt, open an issue to start a discussion.
