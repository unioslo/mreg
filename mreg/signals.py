# Additionally, the Hosts object is saved before the related objects when creating a new host,
# so ipaddress data isn't available at the time of post_save for the Hosts object.
#
# Currently saves a JSON-snapshot of all data for the host.
# TODO: Deleting a host should probably do something. Export/delete log for that host after some time?
