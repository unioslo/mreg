## Overview

### Network Policy

A **Network Policy** is a named entity grouping a set of attributes (via **Policy Attributes**). Policy attributes typically say something about the network, such as whether it is isolated, public, employs DHCP or SLAAC, etc.

- **Name**: Human-readable case insensitive identifier of the policy.
- **Description**: A brief description of the policy.
- **Attributes**: A list of attributes that apply to this policy (see below).
- **Community_mapping_prefix**: A prefix used to map community names to a global name. If `MREG_MAP_GLOBAL_COMMUNITY_NAMES` is set to `True`, this prefix will be used to create a global name for the community. If not set, the global name adhere to the default from the setting `MREG_GLOBAL_COMMUNITY_PREFIX`.

### Policy Attributes

A **Policy Attribute** is a simple boolean flag or marker. Policy Attributes do *not* by themselves define system behavior. Instead, each attribute is a type of marker that can be set for a given policy. These attributes contain no semantic meaning to the system, but are used by other tools to define the behavior of a network policy.

- **Name**: Human-readable case insensitive identifier of the attribute.
- **Description**: A brief description of the attribute.

Note: In `settings.py` the administrators may set `MREG_PROTECTED_POLICY_ATTRIBUTES` set to a list of dictionaries (with `name` and optionally `description` as their fields) to be guaranteed to exist on server startup and protected from deletion. This is useful for attributes that are the site requires to exist at all times.

**Important**:  

- Attributes must first be defined globally (e.g., "isolated," "public," "private") using the **Policy Attribute** endpoints.  
- Then, they are associated with a **Network Policy** and given a value (true/false).  

### Community

A **Community** is a named (case insensitive) collection of **Hosts** (technically, IPs belonging to a host) within a **single** Network. Each community belongs to exactly one network, enabling further subdivision of hosts within that network. This is typically used for client isolation / segmentation. Communities allow you to group hosts based on function, location, access, or other logical groupings.

### Host Membership

**Hosts** in this system can belong to one Community per IP it has. Adding a host to a community requires that at least one of the host’s IP addresses match the network. When adding a host, one can either specify the IP address to associate, or the system will automatically associate the host’s IP address that matches the network. If the host has multiple IPs on the network of the community, a 406 Not Acceptable error will be returned.

Note: Administrators may set `MREG_CREATING_COMMUNITY_REQUIRES_POLICY_WITH_ATTRIBUTES` which will require that a network must have a policy with all the attributes in the list to be able to create a community. `MREG_MAX_COMMUNITES_PER_NETWORK` can be set to limit the number of communities per network. Setting this to 0 will allow an unlimited number of communities.

## Authentication and Permissions

- **IsGrantedNetGroupRegexPermission**:  
  Guards most policy and community endpoints, ensuring users have the correct network group permissions.

- **IsSuperOrNetworkAdminMember**:  
  Used for administrative endpoints, such as creating or managing policy attributes. Only superusers or network admins can create, update, or delete attributes.

```

### Hosts in a Community

#### List / Add Host to a Community

**`GET /api/v1/networks/<network>/communities/<cpk>/hosts/`**
**`POST /api/v1/networks/<network>/communities/<cpk>/hosts/`**

- **GET:** Lists all hosts assigned to this community.
- **POST:** Associates an existing host with this community if it meets the network criteria.

**Example (POST Request):**

If there is only one IP address on the host that matches the network of the community (which is the network in the URL), you can use the following format:

```json
{
  "id": 5  // ID of the existing Host
}
```

If you wish to specify the IP address to associate, either to be explicit or because the host has multiple IPs on the same network, you can use the following format:

```json
{
  "id": 5,
  "ipaddress": "10.0.0.42"
}
```

#### Retrieve / Remove Host from a Community

**`DELETE /api/v1/networks/<network>/communities/<cpk>/hosts/<hostpk>`**

- **GET:** Retrieves details of a specific host in this community.
- **DELETE:** Removes that host from the community.

## Usage Examples

Creating a Network Policy Attribute

**`POST /api/v1/networkpolicyattributes/`**

```json
{
  "name": "Isolated",
  "description": "Marks network isolation if set to true."
}
```

Note: All names are case-insensitive and will be converted to lowercase internally.

Creating a Network Policy

**`POST /api/v1/networkpolicies/`**

```json
{
  "name": "SecurePolicy",
  "attributes": [
    { "attribute": 1, "value": true }
  ]
}
```

Creating a Community under a Network

**`POST /api/v1/networks/1/communities/`**

```json
{
  "name": "BackendServices",
  "description": "All backend service hosts."
}
```

1. Adding a Host to a Community

**`POST /api/v1/networks/1/communities/2/hosts/`**

```json
{
  "id": 42
}
```

The system checks if Host `42` has at least one IP addresses belonging to networks configured under Network Policy `1`.

Response: 201 Created (on success), or 409 Conflict (if the host’s IP doesn’t match).

## Error Handling

- **400 Bad request**: Invalid request data or failed validation (e.g., IP mismatch when adding a host to a community).
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions for the requested operation.
- **404 Not Found**: Policy, community, attribute, or host not found in the system.

## Notes

Fetching a network will now include the policy object in full, as such:

**`GET /api/v1/networks/10.0.0.0/24`**

```json
{
   "id":1,
   "excluded_ranges":[
      
   ],
   "policy":{
      "id":1,
      "name":"test_policy",
      "attributes":[
         
      ],
      "created_at":"2025-01-24T12:24:35.664231+01:00",
      "updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:24:35.664241+01:00"
    },
    "communities":[
        {
          "id":1,
          "name":"test_community",
          "global_name":"community01", // Only set if MREG_MAP_GLOBAL_COMMUNITY_NAMES is True 
          "description":"community desc", 
          "policy":1,
          "hosts":[
              "hostwithcommunity.example.com"
          ],
          "created_at":"2025-01-24T12:24:35.676621+01:00",
          "updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:24:35.676630+01:00"
        }
    ],
    "created_at":"2025-01-24T12:24:35.683213+01:00",
    "updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:24:35.683219+01:00",
    "network":"10.0.0.0/24",
    "description":"test_network",
    "vlan":"None",
    "dns_delegated":false,
    "category":"",
    "location":"",
    "frozen":false,
    "reserved":3
}
```

## Conclusion

The Network Policies API enables administrators to:

- Define Global Attributes (e.g., “isolated”, “public”, “private”, "dhcp", "dhcpv6", etc).
- Create Policies referencing those attributes and associating them with boolean values.
- Assign policies to networks.
- Subdivide a network into Communities, grouping hosts for more granular network management.
- Assign Hosts to Communities under the correct network, provided the host has an IP addresses for the network.
